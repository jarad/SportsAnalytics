# Head-to-head {.unnumbered}

Many sports compete in a head-to-head manner where one team (player) plays
against only one other team (player) at a time. 
Given the score of a game, 
it is clear how good the two teams are compared to each other, 
but not necessarily clear how these teams matchup against other teams. 
Thus, you need a collection of games to understand how good the teams are 
relative to each other. 

In this part, 
we investigate start by constructing models for margin of victory and 
win-loss to produce a team (player) strength rating. 
We then move on to evaluate individual player contributions in a team sport.
