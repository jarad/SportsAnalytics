This part looks into statistical aspects of tournament brackets where one team
(or individual) competes against another team (or individual) at a time.
Tournaments are typically either single or double elimination. 

## Single elimination

In a single elimination tournament, the winning team moves on while the losing 
team is eliminated from the tournament.

## Double elimination

In a double elimination tournament, when a team loses the first time, the
move on in the "losers" brackets.
The championship is between the winner of the winners bracket,
i.e. the team that has never lost, and the winner of the losers bracket.
