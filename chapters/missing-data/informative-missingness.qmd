## NFL Field Goal Kickers

This is a case study on evaluating NFL field goal kickers. 
The data come from the 2009-2011 NFL seasons.

```{r data}
d <- tribble(
  ~kicker, ~season, ~made, ~attempts,
  "Janikowski", 2009, 26, 29,
  "Hartley", 2009, 9, 11,
  "Janikowski", 2010, 33, 41,
  "Hartley", 2010, 20, 25,
  "Janikowski", 2011, 31, 35
)

d |> group_by(kicker) |> 
  summarize(
    made = sum(made),
    attempts = sum(attempts),
    percentage = made / attempts
  )
```

### Logistic Regression (for distance)

But kickers kick from different distances. 

![](hartley_distance.png)

Since we know that distance will affect the probability of making a field goal,
we should adjust for distance when comparing the two kickers. 

We have multiple ways of comparing the two, but one of the simplest is to 
conduct a logistic regression where the response is binary of whether or not
the kick was made and the explanatory variables are distance, kicker, and
the kicker distance interaction.
The interaction is important because it allows the effect of distance on 
probability of making the field goal to be different for each kicker. 

Here we have an interaction between a continuous variable (distance) and 
a categorical/binary variable (kicker). 
We could evaluate whether the interaction has support in the data by doing a
statistical test. 
If we decide, based on that test or other expertise, that we would liek to 
include an interaction, 
then this model is equivalent to running a separate logistic regression for
each kicker. 
Thus individual regression for each kicker with the sole explanatory variable
being distance is reasonable. 

Let $Y_{i,p}$ be in indicator that kick $i$ by player $p$ was made. 
An independent (or individual or separate) logistic regression for each 
kicker with distance as the explanatory variable would look like

$$Y_{i,p} \stackrel{ind}{\sim} Ber(\pi_{i,p}), \quad
\mbox{logit}(\pi_{ip}) = \beta_{0,p} + \beta_{1,p} d_{i,p}
$$
where $d_{i,p}$ is the distance of kick $i$ by player $p$.


In all of the following figures Janikowski is in black and Hartley is in red.

This plot suggests that Janikowski is a better field goal kicker but his 
probability to make field goals is highly affected by distance while Hartley's 
probability is more consistent across the distances. 
Knowledge of these two kickers will tell you that this is not the case since
Janikowski is a renowned long distance kicker. 

### Hierarchical Regression Model

The main reason the analysis suggests the opposite is true is because we do not
have much data on long distance kicks for Hartley. 
Using a random (or mixed) effects model can help to borrow strength across
NFL kickers to better estimate Hartley (and other kickers effectiveness). 
In this case, a random slope model would add an additional assumption
to the logistic regression model above, namely

$$\left[ \begin{array}{c}\beta_{0,p} \\ \beta_{1,p} \end{array}\right] 
\stackrel{ind}{\sim}
N\left(\left[ \begin{array}{c}\beta_{0} \\ \beta_{1} \end{array}\right],
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}\sigma^2_0 & \rho\sigma_0\sigma_1 \\ 
\rho\sigma_0\sigma_1 & \sigma^2_1\end{array}\right]
\right)
$$
where this is a bivariate normal distribution with, across all kickers, 

- $\beta_0$ is the mean intercept, 
- $\beta_1$ is the mean slope,
- $\sigma_0$ is the standard deviation in the intercept,
- $\sigma_1$ is the standard deviation in the slope, and
- $\rho$ is the correlation between the intercepts and slopes.

The key with this model is that all intercepts and slopes are *shrunk* back to
the overall mean intercept and slope across all kickers.
The amount that these are shrunk is inversely related to how much data there is
to support the individual player abilities. 
Thus, players with a lot of data will not be shrunk much while players with a
lot of data will be shrunk a lot. 

The following is the estimate of Hartley (red) and Janikowski (black) probability
of making a kick as a function of distance. 

![](hierarchical_probit.png)

This analysis is intuitively reasonable since Janikowski appears to be the 
better kicker at all distances and the effect of distance being less for
Janikowski compared to Hartley. 

### Missing Model

This is actually a case of missing data. 
The data that are missing are kicks at longer distances (for both kickers). 
There are 4th downs (and some non 4th downs) where it would make sense to try
for a kick, e.g. it is late in the game and the team is down by 3 or fewer 
points. 
In these situations, the coach makes a decision whether to have the kicker 
attempt a field goal or not. 
From our knowledge of the kickers, we know that Janikowski is (relatively)
often asked to attempt long distance kicks compared to Hartley. 
The reason Janikowski is asked to attempt these kicks and Hartley is not is
because the coach believes Janikowski has a (relatively) high probability of
making the kick while Hartley does not. 

Thus, we can build an additional model for the probability of an attempt. 
If this probability of an attempt includes the probability of making the field
goal, then the model can learn about the probability of making the field
goal by whether or not the coach asks the kicker to attempt the kick. 

Let $A_{j,p}$ be an indicator that player $p$ is asked to attempt a field goal
on play $j$. 
A model could be 

$$A_{j,p} \stackrel{ind}{\sim} Ber(\theta_{j,p}), \quad
\mbox{logit}(\theta_{j,p}) = \alpha_{0,p} + \alpha_{1,p} \mbox{logit}(\pi_{j,p})
$$
where we would likely have a hierarchical model for the $\alpha$s.

Incorporating this into the analysis provides an informative missingness 
model. 
The estimated probability for Janikowski (black) and Hartley (red) from this 
model is given below.
