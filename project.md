## Outline

A typical outline for a poster and report for a data analysis includes the 
following sections:

- Introduction
- Data
- Methods 
- Results 
- Discussion

These sections should typically be renamed to be specific to your project. 

Here are 
[some example projects for STAT 5440](https://github.com/jarad/jarad.github.io/tree/master/courses/stat5440/report/examples), 
a graduate course in Bayesian 
Statistics. 
A couple of these analyses are for sports data.
Since these are graduate students, my expectations are higher for these studnets
but really these are only 1 year further along in their program compared to
(some of) you. 


### Introduction

This section should provide a brief introduction to the subject matter you are
discussing and should present the scientific question of interest.
That is, it should state what you are trying to do and why.

### Data

The data section should provide relevant details about the data that you will be 
modeling. 
It should indicate how many data points you have and how many variables you have.
It should include information like the range of values for each variable 
including units, the relationship between the variables, the number of 
observations, etc. 
This section can provide exploratory tables or figures to help the reader 
understand the data. 


### Methods

The methods section should introduce the model that you are fitting to the data
using statistical notation.
The model discussion should include 
how the parameters in this model will be estimated and how this model will
address the scientific question of interests.

(You don't need to include mathematical notation, but if you do follow these
guidelines.)
Introduced notation, e.g. Y_i, X_i, etc, should be defined. 
Statistical notation does not need to be defined, e.g. ind, N(m,C), etc, 
but conventions used in this class should be followed, e.g. C is the variance
in N(m,C). 
If there is a doubt about the convention, then it is best to be explicit.

You should indicate what software you will use, e.g. R, python, and what 
packages were used. 


### Results

The results section should provide summaries of the results of applying methods
from the Methods section on the data in the Data section.
Parameter estimates should be provided. 
If relevant, uncertainty for these estimates should be provided. 
If you are trying  to perform prediction, then some estimate of predictive
performance should be used. 

This section should interpret the results in terms of **what** was observed
but should not get into the **why** of what was observed
(as that is for the Discussion). 

### Discussion

The Discussion section starts with a paragraph recapping what was done:
what was the goal, what data were used, what method was implemented, and 
what were the results. 

The Discussion section includes an assessment of any shortcomings of the model
or method used. 
What could have been improved about the model/method?
What data would have been better?

The Discussion section can also provide next steps, which may be related to 
improvements discussed above. 

Finally, the Discussion should put the analysis in the context of the overall
goal. 



## Evaluation

### Poster

When constructing the poster, use either the Powerpoint or Illustrator 
[horizontal template provided by printing services](https://www.print.iastate.edu/PrintingResources/DesignTemplates/)
with the 40" x 30" size.
Here is Powerpoint version with some information pre-filled

- [Powerpoint](STAT4610X_40x30_PosterTemplate.pptx)

The poster needs to be on time (due on Wednesday May 07 11:59pm) with 10% 
deducted for each hour late.

The report will be graded on a scale of 0-5 for each of 4 categories:  format, grammar, clarity, figure(s) and/or table(s). 
The description below discuss what I am looking for in each of the 5 categories. 


#### Format

Must use the 40 x 30 format. 
The poster should not have excess whitespace, 
i.e. the entire area of the poster should be utilized. 

The poster should include the same sections as described above, 
but generally with less wording and more of an emphasis on figures and tables. 
You should probably never have more than a paragraph of writing for any 
particular section on the poster. 

All figures, tables, and text should be legible. 
In PowerPoint, set magnification to 100% and see if you can read the content. 
You may need to play around with the font size in your graphics as well as the
size you save your figure files as. 


#### Grammar

The report should use proper English grammar.
I suggest you read [The Elements of Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141/) and follow the suggestions therein. 
In particular, make sure 
- words are not misspelled,
- complete sentences are used,
- capitalization is correct, e.g. Bayesian, Table 1, first word in a sentence, etc.,
- don't start sentences with mathematical symbols, and
- thoughts are broken up into paragraphs.



#### Clarity

The poster should be clear but not necessarily complete. 
During a poster presentation, the expectation is that you are there to explain
the poster. 
Thus this criteria will be evaluated during the final poster presentation. 
I will be evaluating whether you can describe what you did and use the poster
to help your description.


#### Figure(s) and Table(s)

The poster should have at least one figure or table.

All figures, tables, and legends should be legible.
The figure(s) and table(s) should demonstrate the point(s) you are trying to make.

Reduce the number of significant digits you use. 






### Report


The report will be graded on a scale of 0-5 for each of 4 categories: length, grammar, design, clarity, figure(s) and/or table(s). 
The description below discuss what I am looking for in each of the 5 categories. 

The report needs to be on time (due on Wednesday May 14 11:59pm) with 10% 
deducted for each hour late.



#### Length

The report is a maximum of 5 pages, singled-spaced with 12 pt font. 

Figures, tables, and their captions can be put later and will not count against the page limit. 
Put figures and tables at the end of the report.


#### Grammar

The report should use proper English grammar.
I suggest you read [The Elements of Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141/) and follow the suggestions therein. 
In particular, make sure 
- words are not misspelled,
- complete sentences are used,
- capitalization is correct, e.g. Bayesian, Table 1, first word in a sentence, etc.,
- don't start sentences with mathematical symbols, and
- thoughts are broken up into paragraphs.


#### Design

The report should follow a logical progression.
I suggest the following sections Introduction, Data, Methods, Results, and Discussion, but rename the sections to something relevant for your project

Avoid through away statements like "is one of the most popular" or 
"is very popular". 


#### Clarity

The report should be written so I can understand what you are doing. 
Specifically, I should be able to understand what your data are and what your model is.
I should be able to understand your interpretation and conclusion. 

You do not need to tell me extraneous information such as the name of your data file or how variables are encoded in your data set. 
Only describe the data you actually used.

Define acronyms before using the acronym. Capitalize acronyms. 


#### Figure(s) and Tables

The report should have at least one figure or table

All figures, tables, legends, and captions should be legible.
Captions should contain enough pertinent information to be able to understand the figure outside of the text.
The figure(s) and table(s) should demonstrate the point(s) you are trying to make.

Reduce the number of significant digits you use.
